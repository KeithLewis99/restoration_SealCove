## glmm ----

# Fifield advised the following
## Compre the results of:
### glmmTMB to glm.  The estimates are virtually identical but the Std. Errors are much smaller for glmmTMB.
### PLOTS/RESULTS WITH AND WITHOUT DISPERSION FOR THE GLMMTMB.

## The estimates are virtually identical but the Std. Errors are slightly smaller than the model with dispersion.  
#Further, the diagnostics look better much better for this model (see below but tested separately for bt.glmm2 which is no longer in the code), especially for homogeneity of variance and this model has a much better AIC. 
# OK, the bt.glmm1 model is best.  Now, its time to see if its valid (Fifield said no need to test the less valid model at this point)?  Talked to Fifield about how to do this.  He and glmmTMB suggest using the DHARMa package

## diagnostics ----
bt.glmm1_simres <- simulateResiduals(bt.glmm1)
# str(bt.glmm1_simres,1)
plot(bt.glmm1_simres)
# The normality and homogeneity of variance look great.  Fifield said that this needs to be looked at for all the usual reasons: normality and homogeneity of variance.  But what about temporal and spatial independence? 


### temporal independence
# But, to look at temporal autocorrelation, we need to recalculate them with Year as a grouping variable
bt.glmm1_simres_recalc <- recalculateResiduals(bt.glmm1_simres, group = bt.np$Year)
# plot(bt.glmm1_simres_recalc) Dave said that this is not required

unique(bt.np$Station_new) # OK - there are only 13 values in this because this is no pools and there are 4 pools + 1 destroyed pool so 18-5=13.

# btyoy.np[btyoy.np$Biomass_100 < 0,]
# plot(density(btyoy.np$Biomass_100))
# 
# # 4 of 98 values are 0.  So, there are a number of options.
# ## #1 inflate the zeros slightly
# ## #2 fall back on lmm with a non-gamma distribution
# ## #3 zero inflated or hurdle
# ## #4 tweadie
# ## # This website gives a great discussion on zi v hurdle and when to use them.  Basically, gamma has to be positive real number.  Is the zero there due to sampling (they just weren't there) or structure (you could well have no btyoy in some places).  This website advises that zi models are a mix while hurdle models have only structural zeros. Clarke suggested in an email that these are structural zeros as larger conspecifics will eat the smaller fish, ergo use a hurdle model.

## pools ----
### the below figure has an almost straight line for the mean and CIs which is a bit wonky.  Why?  Basically, the Year random effect has variance that is almost zero.  The below FAQ page documents what "singular effects" are and why they occur and what to do about it.  
#### https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html
#### From the above page: "If a variance component is zero, dropping it from the model will have no effect on any of the estimated quantities (although it will affect the AIC, as the variance parameter is counted even though it has no effect). Pasch, Bolker, and Phelps (2013) gives one example where random effects were dropped because the variance components were consistently estimated as zero. Conversely, if one chooses for philosophical grounds to retain these parameters, it won’t change any of the answers."
##### I ran the same model without the random effect and the conditional model was exactly the same.  Therefore, keeping the random effects in on philosophical grounds.
